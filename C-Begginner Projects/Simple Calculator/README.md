**Let me introduce you to my C project**
<br>
*A simple calculator*
## Features
Firstly, it will welcome the user and provide the choices.
 
It is a menu-driven project providing the user with 7 choices:
1. Addition 
2. Subtraction
3. Multiplication 
4. Division 
5. Modulus 
6. Power
7. Exit

A user can make their choice and perform simple calculations. 

## Error handling 

If the user enters a number which is not a valid choice, the program will automatically **exit**.

If the user wants to divide or get the modulus of any number divided by 0, the program will give a standard error: **Invalid argument for Division**.

## Exit
 If the user is done with their work, they can exit the program by choosing option 7.

 Finally, it will print *Thank you*.
